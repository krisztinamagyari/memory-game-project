## Instructions

#### Aim of the game

#### How to play the game

The game area contains 8 pairs of cards (16 cards altogether). Flip any cards by clicking on it. In one move you can flip 2 cards. If they match, they remain turned up.
If they are not matching cards, try to memorize them, and find their pairs in one of the following moves.
When you match all cards, a congratulation window appears, informing you about your results:
- the number of moves
- the star rating you have reached
  - :star: :star: :star: : 10 or less moves
  - :star: :star: : 11-20 moves
  - :star: : more than 20 moves
- the time taken to finish the game

If you click on the **Try again!** button, you can restart the game, and reach even better results.

In case for any reasons you would like to restart the game, just click on the **restart** icon just above the upper-right corner of the card deck area.
