AIM OF THE GAME

Match the cards as fast as you can: The less moves you make, the better.

INSTRUCIONS

Flip any cards by clicking on it. In one move you can flip 2 cards. If they match, they remain turned up.
If they are not matching cards, try to memorize them, and find their pairs in one of the following moves.
When you match all cards, a popup window appears, informing you about your results.
If you click on the button, you can restart the game, and reach even better results.
